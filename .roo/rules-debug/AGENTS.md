# Debugging Rules

No non-obvious debug rules were identified for this project. Debugging efforts should focus on standard practices, leveraging browser developer tools for frontend issues and inspecting network requests for API interactions. The custom code checker (`scripts/code-checker.mjs`) can provide early warnings for project-specific conventions.
