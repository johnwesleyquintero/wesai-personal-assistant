# WesAI Personal Assistant

Your AI-powered personal assistant and creative partner.

WesAI Personal Assistant is a product of [ScaleSmart](https://wescode.vercel.app/). It is a client-side web application that leverages the Google Gemini API (for text-based tasks) and Imagen API (for image generation) to provide intelligent assistance, content creation, image generation, and an interactive chat mode, with a special focus on personal productivity and creative tasks.

This documentation describes the WesAI Personal Assistant version of WesAI.

## Key Features

- **Login Page:** Provides a basic client-side login to protect API key usage.
- **API Key Management:** Allows secure saving and removal of your Gemini API key using browser local storage, including confirmation before key removal to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Enables switching between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing, with preference saved.

- **Content Creation:** Creates various types of written content based on your description (e.g., blog posts, social media updates, documentation sections, email copy).
- **Image Generation:** Generates images based on your description using Google's Imagen model, with a download option.
- **Interactive Chat Mode:**
  - Ask follow-up questions about generated content or images.
  - Get general assistance for various tasks.
  - Live preview for certain content types generated in chat.
- **In-App Documentation:** Allows viewing this README directly within the application for easy reference.
- **Sleek UI:** Features a modern, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS, with theme support and convenient "clear input" buttons.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with class-based Dark Mode).
- **AI:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` for text tasks, `imagen-3.0-generate-002` for image generation).
- **Build Tool:** Vite.
- **Modules:** Loaded via ES Modules and `esm.sh` for CDN access in development, bundled by Vite for production.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Ensure this key is enabled for both the Gemini API and the Imagen API (often covered by "Generative Language API" or similar in Google Cloud Console if using project-based keys).

### Running Locally (Using Vite Dev Server - Recommended)

1.  **Download/Clone:** Ensure all project files and folders are in a single project directory.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn).
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install
    # Or using yarn
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variable (Optional but Recommended for Dev):**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    - Add your Gemini API key to this file:
      ```env
      VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
      ```
    - **IMPORTANT:** Do not commit your `.env` file or real API keys to version control. The `.gitignore` file (if you create one) should include `.env`.
4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run dev
    # Or using yarn
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
5.  **Login:**
    - When you first open the application, you will be prompted to log in.
    - The password is: **`wesai_rocks`**
    - _(Note: This is a hardcoded password for local/personal use to protect API key access and is not secure for production environments.)_
6.  **API Key Setup (if not using `.env` or to override):**
    - After logging in, you'll see the "Manage Gemini API Key" section.
    - If you didn't set the `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` or wish to use a different key, enter your Gemini API Key into the input field.
    - Click "Save Key." The key will be stored in your browser's local storage for future sessions and will take precedence over the environment variable.
    - **Security Note:** Storing API keys in browser local storage is convenient for client-side tools but can be a security risk if the site is vulnerable to XSS attacks. For production applications with multiple users, API keys should ideally be managed on a secure backend server.

## How to Use

1.  **Login** to the application.
2.  **Set your API Key** if it's not already configured (either via `.env` or the UI).
3.  **Toggle Theme (Optional):** Use the sun/moon icon in the header to switch between light and dark modes.
4.  **Select a Tab:**

    - **Content:** Describe the written content you need (e.g., blog post idea, tweet, email draft) and click "Create Content."
    - **Image:** Type a description of the image you want (a "prompt") and click "Generate Image." You can then download the result.
    - **Chat:** Click the "Chat" tab. Ask questions related to previous AI outputs. Certain content types in chat can be previewed live.
    - **Documentation:** Click the "Documentation" tab to view this README file.

5.  **View Results:** Generated content/images, and chat responses will appear.
6.  **Copy Output:** Use the copy buttons on output panels or chat messages.
7.  **Clear Inputs:** Use the "X" icon next to input fields to quickly clear them.
8.  **Logout:** Click the "Logout" button in the API key management section. This will also clear any API key set via the UI.

## Building for Production

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
2.  **Run the Build Script:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder with optimized, static assets.
3.  **Preview Production Build (Optional):**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or
    yarn preview
    ```
4.  **Serve from `dist`:** Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static site hosting service. Ensure your hosting service correctly serves `index.html` for all route paths if you implement client-side routing beyond the hash. (Currently, this app doesn't use complex routing).

## Deployment

WesAI Code Assistant can be deployed as a static web application.

1.  Run the build script: `npm run build` (or `yarn build`).
2.  Deploy the contents of the generated `dist` folder to any platform that supports static site hosting, such as:
    _ Vercel
    _ Netlify
    _ GitHub Pages
    _ Cloudflare Pages \* Firebase Hosting
    Ensure `README.md` is in the `public` folder (Vite default) or configured to be copied to the `dist` folder so it can be fetched by the Documentation tab. (In the current setup, Vite will copy files from `public` to `dist` root).

## Future Ideas

- More advanced chat context retention and history management.
- Integration with other personal productivity tools.

## Limitations

- The live preview feature for certain content types in the chat interface is currently not working as expected. Our team is actively reviewing this bug.
