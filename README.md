## What WesAI Can Do

- **Secure Access:** A simple login page helps protect access to the application and your API key.

- **Customizable Look:** Easily switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing, and the app remembers your preference.

- **Create Written Content:** Generate various types of text, like blog posts, social media updates, documentation, or emails, just by describing what you need.
- **Generate Images:** Create unique images from your descriptions using Google's Imagen model, with an option to download your creations.
- **Interactive Chat:**
  - Ask follow-up questions about the content or images the AI creates.
  - Get general help with different tasks.
  - See a live preview for some types of content generated in the chat.
- **Built-in Help:** Access this documentation anytime directly within the application.
- **Modern Design:** Enjoy a clean, responsive interface built with modern web technologies, featuring theme support and easy-to-use clear input buttons.

## Getting Started

To use WesAI Personal Assistant, you will need:

- A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Make sure this key works for both the Gemini API (for text) and the Imagen API (for images).

Once you have the application files and your API key:

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  You will see a login page. The user and password for local/personal use are **`demo`**, **`password`**.
3.  After logging in, go to the "Manage Gemini API Key" section.
4.  Enter your Google Gemini API Key into the input field and click "Save Key". Your key will be stored securely in your browser's local storage so you don't have to enter it every time.

**Important Security Note:** Storing API keys in your browser is convenient for personal tools but is not recommended for applications used by many people. For those cases, API keys should be handled on a secure server.

## How to Use

1.  **Login** to the application.
2.  **Set your API Key** if you haven't already.
3.  **Change Theme (Optional):** Click the sun/moon icon in the top bar to switch between light and dark modes.
4.  **Choose what you want to do:**
    - **Content:** Describe the text you want to create (like a blog post or email) and click "Create Content."
    - **Image:** Type a description (a "prompt") for the image you want and click "Generate Image." You can then download the image.
    - **Chat:** Click the "Chat" tab to ask questions about previous AI outputs or get general help. Some content types will show a live preview here.
    - **Documentation:** Click the "Documentation" tab to read this guide.
5.  **See the Results:** The generated text, images, or chat responses will appear on the screen.
6.  **Copy Output:** Use the copy buttons next to the generated content or chat messages.
7.  **Clear Inputs:** Click the "X" icon next to the input boxes to quickly clear them.
8.  **Logout:** Click the "Logout" button in the API key management section. This will also remove your API key from the browser.

## Limitations

- The live preview feature for some content types in the chat is currently not working correctly. We are working to fix this issue.
